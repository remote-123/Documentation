# DxLock

Rapidly selling a large quantity of tokens can lead to price volatility, which can trigger panic selling and ultimately result in the downfall of a project and loss of investment. These schemes, known as "pump and dump" or "rug pull" are detrimental to building trust in a project. DxSale's unique "DxLock" feature allows creators to control the pace and quantity of token sales, providing reassurance to investors of their commitment to the project's long-term success. This feature also allows investors to use it as a hedge against fraud and a means to protect their investments.

### **Lock Types**

**Regular Locker**

The token Locker works by depositing a certain number of tokens. This ensures that you won’t dump the number of tokens after launch

**LP Locker**

This Locker keeps the LP tokens you provide in a smart contract to initiate the liquidity pool for your project. Same as the Regular Locker, they help you gain your investors’ trust.

**Reward Locker**

These lockers are exclusive for tokens with reflection tokens like Tikki/Baby Tokens and guarantee the reflections you make are kept in the Locker. You can claim these rewards whenever you want!

(A 1% fee of the reward tokens is charged for claiming them, this fee goes to our SALE holders.)

DxLock is the only app to offer reward lockers. Reward lockers allow you to claim any rewards your token earns you such as BNB, ETH, USDT, BUSD or more anytime. Please note this is not a reflection token locker, reflections will accumulate and can only be withdrawn once the lock expires.
