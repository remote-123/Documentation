# DxLock

If a great quantity of tokens is sold too fast a price shock transpires. This can lead to more panic selling which usually results in the early death of a project and general loss of capital. Such schemes are commonly referred to as “pump and dump” or “rug pull”. This is why assuring price stability is one of the most important ways to promote trust in a project. By using “**DxLock**” creators can define when and how many tokens can be sold to reassure investors of their intentions. Of course, investors will be able to use this feature as well as a hedge against fraud or as a means to save up.



**Lock Types**

**Regular Locker**

The token Locker works by depositing a certain number of tokens. This ensures that you won’t dump the number of tokens after launch

&#x20;**LP Locker**

This Locker keeps the LP tokens you provide in a smart contract to initiate the liquidity pool for your project. Same as the Regular Locker, they help you gain your investors’ trust.

&#x20;**Reward Locker**

These lockers are exclusive for tokens with reflection tokens like SafeMoon and guarantee the reflections you make are kept in the Locker. You can claim these rewards whenever you want!
