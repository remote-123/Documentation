# DxDrop

Positive reinforcement is a mighty tool to keep your community engaged which, in turn, can facilitate funding efforts. For instance, gratitude can be expressed by rewarding tokens or native currency (like BNB on BSC) to early backers for reached milestones, creating a space of mutual benefit and elevated confidence to further support the project.

**How to**

****![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (50).png>)****

1. Connect your wallet
2. Enter the token address
3. Enter a list where each line contains the address of a recipient and the amount of tokens, separated by a comma
4. After you checked all the information hit "approve"

\-> In the example, the first address is receiving 10 tokens and the second is receiving 100 tokens.

The same applies when you want to airdrop some base currency like BNB. For this to work you will need to change the airdrop type.

**Number of Addresses**

Depending on the chain, the number of simultaneous transactions can vary because of different block sizes. If you experience any errors, consider reducing the number of transactions issued at a time.
