# Is DxSale safe to use?

As the largest IDO platform with now more than 13’000 projects launched, and no recorded hacks since we went live, there is a good case to be made that Dx, as a service, is safe to use. Dx has no direct access to your wallet nor do we possess the ability to alter your project at any point. The smart contracts are entirely independent and do not contain proxy functions so we can't access your presale nor stop presales you participate in.

We’re working tirelessly to ensure that our platform is as simple and as safe to use as possible.
