# Lexical Questions/Glossary

**What is a Wallet?**

A Cryptocurrency Wallet is where your private and your public key is stored. This enables you to send and receive Cryptocurrency. Your private key is the password used to send crypto and your public key is used as your address for others to send crypto to. With those two features combined your wallet is also where your cryptocurrency is stored.

**Important Note:** Never share your Private Key! Your Public Key can be compared to your email address. Other people will use it to send you crypto. Your Private Key on the other hand is the password you use to access your crypto. If somebody can attain your Private Key, they will have access to all your crypto, and in most cases use it to send it somewhere else.

**What is a launchpad?**

A Crypto Launchpad is a platform that allows blockchain-based projects to raise capital while giving early investors access to tokens at a bargain price. If the funding process is successful, the project is officially launched which usually results in rising prices of the project token. This dynamic can be seen as one of the many benefits of using a Launchpad. Projects can secure their funding and early backers can make a great return on their initial investment.
