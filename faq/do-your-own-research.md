# DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH

**⚠️ Devs can still create fraudulent code within their token to exit ⚠️**

All we ensure is locking of liquidity. Users still need to do their own research for each project.

**You have to study the telegram group, the twitter page, the website.**

Go and ask the team questions. Get a feel for their responses and make your own decision before you take part.

**DxSale cannot be held liable for anyone participating in presales without doing the necessary research.**

**The DeFi zone is also a lot riskier and requires much more attention to detail.**

## **I**f you aren't sure about something avoid it.
