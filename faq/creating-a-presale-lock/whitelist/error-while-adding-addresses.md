# Error while adding Addresses?

If you get an error message when trying to add more addresses, then you probably didn't check your addresses before adding them.

### How do I check my Addresses?

Basically all addresses should be valid Addresses. The best way to do this, is with an editor:

We will use these following tools to check our addresses:

* [https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/)
* [https://delim.co/#](https://delim.co/#)

#### 1. Load the Addresses separated by "NewLine" into a new File

#### 2. Delete the duplicates:

#### 3. Use the online tool to seperate the addresses by ","

#### 4. Now it should work. If you still get errors, make sure to split up your addresses in smaller batches and check for invalid address.
