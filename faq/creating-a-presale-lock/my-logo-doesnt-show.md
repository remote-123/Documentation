# My Logo Doesn't Show

**Logos need to be image URLS that end in .png, .jpg, .jpeg, or .gif file extensions.**\
****\
**Logos should be at max in 256x256 file dimensions.**

Example [http://i.epvpimg.com/lHBqdab.png](http://i.epvpimg.com/lHBqdab.png)

**If URLS don't end in the correct file extension they will not load!**

I can recommend you this service, there you got the possibility to choose the "direct link"

{% embed url="https://epvpimg.com/" %}
