# My logo doesn't show

**Logos need to be image URLS that end in .png, .jpg, .jpeg, or .gif file extensions.**\
\*\*\*\*\
**Logos should be at max in 256x256 file dimensions.**

Example [http://i.epvpimg.com/lHBqdab.png](http://i.epvpimg.com/lHBqdab.png)

**If URLS don't end in the correct file extension, they will not load!**

We recommend the following service, there you've got the possibility to choose the "direct link".

{% embed url="https://epvpimg.com/" %}
