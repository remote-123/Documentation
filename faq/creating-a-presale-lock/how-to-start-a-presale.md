# How To Start A Presale?

_**If you want to start a presale make sure you know and understand your sourcecode.**_

**Here is a Checklist for what to do before starting:**

1. I understand the functions of my contract.
2. I did disable all special transfer functions in my contract.
3. I disabled all fees or anything similar while I do my presale.
4. If I limit the Max Tokens per Wallet or Max Transaction Amount I did set this to 100% of my supply.
5. **I didn't renounce ownership of my contract.**
6. I am aware of what Liquidity is.
7. **I didn't add Tokens to the DEX already.**
