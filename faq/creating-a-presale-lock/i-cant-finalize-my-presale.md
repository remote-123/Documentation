# I Can't Finalize My Presale

**Finalize can be called within 48hours when your presale is within 1 minimum contribution amount of the hardcap or when the timer runs out.**

_Your BNBs then gets sent to the connected DEX for creating the Pool for your Liquidity, the rest % of the BNBs gets send to the Presale Initator wallet. So - 75% Pancake --> 25% BNBs to your wallet._

**If you are having issues with finalizing: go through this checklist to see if you did everything correctly:**

1. I excluded the two addresses given in the SALE panel from the fees of my contract.
2. I did set all fees to "0"
3. If I got a Safemoon function clone, I did set the function "**SwapAndLiquify**" to "**false**"
4. I did set the **MaxTransactionAmmount** to _100% of my supply._
5. I don't have any Transaction limitations on my contract enabled
6. I got the **right router address** in my source
7. **Now you should be able to finalize and can set your fees and function as wished.**
