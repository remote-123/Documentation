# Too Large Supply Error?

Uniswap V2 has a limit on the maximum amount of Tokens in their liquidity.\
\
For us, this plays an important role, since we are about to add this liquidity for you to the router.\
\
To make this possible, please ensure to reduce your decimals if you want to go with a token with a very big supply.\
\
Max Supply + Decimals = Max Amount of Tokens in the Liquidity

## Example:

| MaxSupply                  | Decimals               |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| 10000000000000000000000000 | 000000(6)              |
| 10000000000000000000000    | 000000000(9)           |
| 10000000000000             | 000000000000000000(18) |

(This is the Maximum, so yeah rather put a zero away)
