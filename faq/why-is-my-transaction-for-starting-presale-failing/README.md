### Time error

You may get a pop up timer error or you may get an error during the final submission page of your presale creation. This is due to the time that you have chosen. There are cases where users start creating the presale 10 minutes prior to their preferred time; however, click submit after their preferred time that they've chosen on the first page. If this happens, you will get a transaction failure or error. Please choose a time that is half an hour or more so it gives you time to make decisions when choosing presale time.

### Wallet money amount&#x20;

You need to have at least fee + $50 worth of native coins for having a smooth transaction. One of the most common issues that users have faced is that their wallets lack the adequate funds for making the presale which causes transaction errors on metamask or similar wallets.
