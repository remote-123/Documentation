# Is Dxsale legit as a Project?

Dx has been an established platform for two years, all the contracts have been audited by CertiK. We had several successful launches like Safemoon, CumRocket, Elon Gate, and more. Our revenue model and DAO are well documented and transparent.

One of the criticisms we get is that the people behind Dx are not known by their full name. We understand the concern behind this complaint, but this is a decision we had to make to protect our privacy. Although our true identities are not public knowledge (yet), we constantly engage with our community in our dedicated telegram chat groups to help out as well as we can. This kind of community support isn’t always easy but given how much work we’ve put into it so far should make our intentions obvious: **We want our space to grow through successful projects and satisfied users.**
