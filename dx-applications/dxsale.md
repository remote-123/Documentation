**REGULAR PRESALE:** &#x20;

This is a traditional launch for a token. Users can contribute to presale until timer ends or until hardcap is reached.&#x20;

* This launch type has a softcap and a hardcap. &#x20;
* There is a minimum and maximum contribution limit set by the owner. &#x20;
* The hard cap / softcap ratio cannot be more than 2 (ex: if SC is 50, HC cannot exceed 100).&#x20;
* There is presale rate and DEX listing rate to be chosen by the owner. Presale rate is the rate(ex: 1000 tokens/ 1 BNB) during presale and listing rate is the rate at which the token will be listed in DEX.&#x20;
* The start time must be at least 10 minutes in future.&#x20;
* The end time cannot exceed more than a month.&#x20;
* Project owner can choose to allow only whitelisted users to contribute. It can be opened to public as well at the discretion of the owner.&#x20;
* At least 51% of the raise must be added to DEX liquidity.&#x20;
* The liquidity must be locked for at least 1 month.&#x20;
* If the token used has fees, all fees must be turned off until the raise is complete and token listed on a DEX.&#x20;
* Owner can decide before finalization to change the listing pair for DEX from native token(ETH,BNB etc) to a stable coin (USDC, USDT etc).&#x20;
* The owner can choose to vest the token claims instead of single claim by contributors.&#x20;

&#x20;

**FAIR LAUNCH:**&#x20;

This is a special launch type with no set hardcap. Users can contribute to the presale until timer ends. &#x20;

* This launch type has a softcap which is the minimum amount needed to be raised for the presale to be considered a success. &#x20;
* There is a minimum and maximum contribution limit set by the owner.&#x20;
* The presale owner sets a fixed number of tokens for contributors of fairlaunch and a set numberof tokens for dex listing.&#x20;
* The rate for contributors and DEX listing is determined after the presale time ends using the formula: _**presale tokens / total contributions.**_ &#x20;
* The start time must be at least 10 minutes in future.&#x20;
* The end time cannot exceed more than a month.&#x20;
* Project owner can choose to allow only whitelisted users to contribute. It can be opened to public as well at the discretion of the owner.&#x20;
* At least 51% of the raise must be added to DEX liquidity.&#x20;
* The liquidity must be locked for at least 1 month.&#x20;
* If the token used has fees, all fees must be turned off until the raise is complete and token listed on a DEX.&#x20;
* Owner can decide before finalization to change the listing pair for DEX from native token(ETH,BNB etc) to a stable coin (USDC, USDT etc).&#x20;

&#x20;

**OVERFLOW LAUNCH:**&#x20;

This is a special launch type with a soft cap and hard cap. Users can contribute to the presale until timer ends. &#x20;

* This launch type has a softcap which is the minimum amount needed to be raised for the presale to be considered a success. &#x20;
* The project owner also gets to set a hard cap after presale creation. This is the max amount the owner wants to raise and decides with their community.&#x20;
* There is a minimum and maximum contribution limit set by the owner.&#x20;
* The presale owner sets a fixed number of tokens for contributors of the overflow and a set number of tokens for dex listing.&#x20;
* The rate for contributors and DEX listing is determined after the overflow time ends.&#x20;
* Contributors token claim amount is calculated using the formula: _**overflow contributors’ tokens /  total contribution amount.**_&#x20;
* In Overflow, since a hard cap is set, anything that is raised beyond the hard cap is refunded to the contributors proportionally. The formula used is: _**(1 – (hardcap/total raised)) X contributor’s amount.**_&#x20;
* If softcap is reached but hardcap is not reached, the overflow acts as a regular presale for all the above mentioned logic.&#x20;
* The start time must be at least 10 minutes in future.&#x20;
* The end time cannot exceed more than a month.&#x20;
* Project owner can choose to allow only whitelisted users to contribute. It can be opened to public as well at the discretion of the owner.&#x20;
* At least 51% of the raise must be added to DEX liquidity.&#x20;
* The liquidity must be locked for at least 1 month.&#x20;
* If the token used has fees, all fees must be turned off until the raise is complete and token listed on a DEX.&#x20;
* Owner can decide before finalization to change the listing pair for DEX from native token(ETH,BNB etc) to a stable coin (USDC, USDT etc).&#x20;
