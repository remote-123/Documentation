# DxSale Introduction

**DxSale Introduction**

[DxSale](https://dx.app/?ref=raphaeldx\&chain=BNB) is an advanced web3.0 platform designed to cater to the needs of users in the rapidly growing cryptocurrency decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. The platform enables users to create their own tokens through [DxMint](https://dx.app/dxmint?ref=raphaeldx\&chain=BNB), raise funds via [DxSale](https://dx.app/dxsale?ref=raphaeldx\&chain=BNB), and secure their tokens with [DxLock](https://dx.app/dxlock?ref=raphaeldx\&chain=BNB).

Built on the decentralized principles of platforms like Uniswap, [DxSale](https://dx.app/dxsale?ref=raphaeldx\&chain=BNB) empowers anyone to participate in its launches without any limitations, unlike traditional launchpads that impose token-holding or staking requirements on users. Our application is designed from the ground up and revolutionizes the way new tokens are introduced in Decentralized Finance (DeFi).  Our contracts are completely audited with [Skynet enabled by Certik](https://www.certik.com/projects/dxsale)

Established in 2020 by a team of cryptocurrency enthusiasts, [DxSale](https://dx.app/dxsale?ref=raphaeldx\&chain=BNB) was developed in response to the limitations and drawbacks associated with traditional crowdfunding methods in the pre-[DxSale](https://dx.app/dxsale?ref=raphaeldx\&chain=BNB) era. Prior to [DxSale](https://dx.app/dxsale?ref=raphaeldx\&chain=BNB), participants in the cryptocurrency market had to rely on trust-based systems, sending their funds to unidentified individuals' wallets, hoping to receive a token that would eventually be listed on exchanges. This approach led to numerous scams and significant financial losses for users.

With the advent of [DxSale](https://dx.app/dxsale?ref=raphaeldx\&chain=BNB), token creators are now encouraged to use DxSale or similar launchpads to debut their tokens, as the platform automatically connects to Decentralized Exchanges (DEX). DEXs facilitate the swift listing of tokens with funding, allowing users from around the globe to trade seamlessly. This innovation has significantly reduced the risk of fund misappropriation during the crowdfunding process. Furthermore, upon completion of crowdfunding through [DxSale](https://dx.app/dxsale?ref=raphaeldx\&chain=BNB), the token and funds are transferred to the DEX, where liquidity is automatically locked via [DxLock](https://dx.app/dxlock?ref=raphaeldx\&chain=BNB). This additional security measure makes it increasingly difficult for malicious token creators to misappropriate funds from the DEX, as the liquidity pool token's key is locked within [DxLock](https://dx.app/dxlock?ref=raphaeldx\&chain=BNB).

Initially launched on the Ethereum network, [DxSale](https://dx.app/dxsale?ref=raphaeldx\&chain=BNB) has since expanded its scope to accommodate the growing popularity of Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) networks. As a result, the platform now supports a total of 18 networks, further enhancing its versatility and appeal to users across the DeFi ecosystem.

[DxSale](https://dx.app/dxsale?ref=raphaeldx\&chain=BNB) offers users reliability and safety when buying new tokens with the addition of features such as KYC and Audit. By partnering with some of the best auditors and KYC providers out there including Certik, [DxSale](https://dx.app/dxsale?ref=raphaeldx\&chain=BNB) is number 1 when it comes to the safety and security of its users.
