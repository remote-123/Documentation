**Dx Introduction**

With currently 13 supported chains, Dx is the biggest IDO Launchpad in the crypto space. As a truly decentralized token management platform, we aim for a low-barrier approach to launching your project. Instead of a steep learning curve and cumbersome interfaces, our platform will provide all the necessary tools to create and launch your project with no prior coding skills required. Of course, you can also use our platform if you’re just here to invest in a project you deem interesting. This will be the first decision you will face:

Are you an investor or a creator?

If you’re both: **Even better**. But let’s take one thing at a time.

First, check out the list of our official staff below. If you have any questions that can't be answered by reading our documentation consider asking them for advice in our official chat groups which are listed under the section "Links".
