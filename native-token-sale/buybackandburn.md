# BuyBackAndBurn

**Revenue Model**

Our revenue model is based on launch fees and a BuyBackandBurn-Model of our native currency **SALE**. This works by sending all transactions made on our platform to a Burn Contract, which can be found [**here**](https://dxsale.app/app/v3/feemanagement?chain=BSC)**.**

Users can select any token that is being stored in our contract and sell it to a decentralized exchange. SALE token holders can execute the “BuyBack” which uses 50% of the funds to buy tokens from our native currency and send them to the Burn Address daily.

In short: **50% of all revenue generated on DxSale goes to buying and burning the token.** The subsequent burn of these SALE tokens reduces the supply, making SALE ultra-deflationary.
