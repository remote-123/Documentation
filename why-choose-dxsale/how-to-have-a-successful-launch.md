# How to have a successful launch

A successful launch means filling or exceeding the raise amount for your token. A healthy community and post raise marketing will take your token to the next level. To achieve a successful launch and healthy community post raise, you must ensure that your pre-launch is smooth.

> _<mark style="color:orange;">As a rule of thumb, you always require 20% of raise as marketing budget. If you are raising 100k usd for your token, you should spend 20k usd for the smoothest launch possible</mark>_
