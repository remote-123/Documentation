# Service Fees

[DxSale](https://dx.app/?ref=raphaeldx\&chain=BNB) is **STILL** the only launchpad that has anti dump mechanism tied to the DxDAO. Any fees collected by our launchpad services such as token fee cannot be dumped by default. You can find our service fees during submission page of each product such as [DxMint](https://dx.app/dxmint?ref=raphaeldx\&chain=BNB) , [DxSale](https://dx.app/dxsale?ref=raphaeldx\&chain=BNB) or [DxLock](https://dx.app/dxlock?ref=raphaeldx\&chain=BNB).\


{% hint style="warning" %}
The gas fee changes depends on the network. The overall DxSale fee is same on all networks however the gas fee can significantly increase or decrease depending on the network that you are trying to use. For example, Ethereum gas fees may be as high as $20 usd.
