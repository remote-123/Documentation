# DxMint Tutorial

1. **Head to "DxMint"**

****![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (47).png>)****

Everything you will need to do in order to create your token will take place in this section.

**2.  Connect your wallet**

**4. Choose Token Type**

****![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (55).png>)****

Right now there are two token types to choose from:

&#x20;**Standard Token**

This is a Utility Token. Utility Tokens are tokens that have a value tied to their ownership, which means they can be used for commercial intent.

&#x20;**Features:**

* No special functions like additional fees
* Basic Send/Approve/Allowance Contract. An ERC20 token contract keeps track of fungible tokens: every token is exactly equal to any other token; no tokens have special rights or behavior associated with them.&#x20;
* This makes ERC20 tokens useful for things like a medium of exchange currency, voting rights, staking, and more.

&#x20;

**Liquidity Generator Token**

This token is basically a Safemoon fork. The liquidity fee gets collected on your contract when it reaches a certain predefined limit. Half of the tokens on the contract are getting added as LP tokens to the liquidity pool.

**5. Fill out the Form**

**Token Name:**

Put the full name of your Token here.

**Token Symbol:**

This functions like a ticker symbol. For example: "Avalanche" is the name, "AVAX" is the symbol.

**Token Decimal:**

When picking a suitable value for decimals these rules should be followed:

* Does the token contract represent an indivisible entity? Then set decimals to “0”
* Does the token contract represent an item with a fixed number of decimal places? Then set decimals to that number.
* If neither of the above applies set decimals to “**18**”.

**Total Supply:**

Set the total amount of tokens. There are no hard rules on how many tokens should be minted.

Two things to note:

* Stop using dollar-amounts for your calculations. Use percentages instead.
* The value of your token may increase faster with a lower supply.

6**. Hit Create**

Newly equipped with your token you can now head to “**DxLaunch**”. There you will be asked again to connect your wallet first. Once connected you can choose on what DEX you want to launch your token, enter your token address, set the amount of tokens you want in presale as well as a soft and hard cap, contribution limit, liquidity, listing price and fill out the additional information (e.g. links to social media). Now just hit submit, deposit your tokens and confirm the transaction in your wallet. Congratulations, **you have launched your own project!**
