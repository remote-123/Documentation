# For Creators

**I’m a creator, what do I do?**

As a creator, you will be taken on what we call the “token journey”. To launch your project you’ll first have to create a token. This can be done by using “**DxMint**”. But first, make sure you have your wallet ready with the gas currency supported by our chains. After connecting your wallet you will be able to choose what kind of token you want to create. Then you just have to fill out the form consisting of your tokens name, symbol, decimal, and total supply, hit “**create**” and, as easy as that, your token has now officially been created.
