# Dividend Token

Dividend token is a token type that allows holders to get rewards if eligible and also get rewarded automatically from any buys and sells. Holders have double benefits.

Liquidity fee is collected via buying or selling the token, and the fee is then used to give holders native coin or give holders any custom token of your choice.
