# Token Lock Tutorial

DxLock’s standard locker is the simplest way to lock your token under 2 minutes. To start using it, simply select Lock Tokens.

You can click any of the pre-minted tokens on DxMint to do this step or if you have a token that you have created already, simply copy and paste it on the text section.

Once you paste your address you will see the website showing you more options. You must choose the amount of tokens that you want to lock via DxLock. To select you can either put the amount of tokens via text box or use the slider to give a % based amount that you want to select for the lock.

Next is an optional token vesting feature, you can use it if you would like periodical withdraw instead of a full withdraw at the unlocking time. To read more about this please see the next subsection.

Next option is the calendar and timer for Unlock Time. Use the easy to use calendar feature to select the token unlock date.

{% hint style="info" %}
Highly recommend filling out Logo Url and Link to identify your project to give your community an easy identification to look for if they ever search for your token. A missing logo url or website is usually seen by communities as lack of care for the project

Once you click Lock Tokens, you will be greeted with Metamask Confirmation. Approve the tokens to lock, then press Confirm to confirm your lock. Of the tokens locked, 1% will be taken as fees, rest will be locked in the locker.\
