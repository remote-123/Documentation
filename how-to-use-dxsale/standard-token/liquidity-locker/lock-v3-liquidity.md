Once you paste your address you will see the website showing you more options. You must choose the amount of tokens that you want to lock via DxLock. To select you can either put the amount of tokens via text box or use the slider to give a % based amount that you want to select for the lock.

Next option is the calendar and timer for Unlock Time. Use the easy to use calendar feature to select the token unlock date.

Highly recommend filling out Logo Url and Link to identify your project to give your community an easy identification to look for if they ever search for your token. A missing logo url or website is usually seen by communities as lack of care for the project
