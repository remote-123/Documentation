# DxLock

Rapidly selling a large quantity of tokens can lead to price volatility, which can trigger panic selling and ultimately result in the downfall of a project and loss of investment. These schemes, known as "pump and dump" or "rug pull" are detrimental to building trust in a project. [DxSale's](https://dx.app/?ref=raphaeldx\&chain=BNB) unique "[DxLock](https://dx.app/dxlock?ref=raphaeldx\&chain=BNB)" feature allows creators to control the pace and quantity of token sales, providing reassurance to investors of their commitment to the project's long-term success. This feature also allows investors to use it as a hedge against fraud and a means to protect their investments.
