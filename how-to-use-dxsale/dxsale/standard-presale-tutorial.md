# Standard Presale Tutorial

Presale or standard presale is very simple type of presale, once you list your presale, buyers can buy the token from you at a presale rate of your choice which is then listed on a DEX at a listing rate of your choice.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Some of the features such as Vesting and White listing can be enabled and used after presale has been listed
{% endhint %}

Once you understand how the presale flow works please see the tutorial steps below:

**Creating the presale steps**

Once you click Create Presale, you will be greeted with the following steps and form. You must complete each steps and forms correctly in order to successfully list the presale. Estimated time is 10 minutes if you are doing everything correctly.

**Token Info**

Copy paste your token address on the first step to get started.

**Presale Information**

Once you get to Create your Presale, you are welcomed by couple of forms as shown below. Do not worry, we explain each of the items right below the screenshot.

&#x20;

&#x20;

**Presale Rate**

Presale Rate is the rate at which users get your token when they pay with native token during presale/crowdfunding/Initial Coin Offering/ Initial Dex offering



{% hint style="info" %}
Presale Rate must be equal or more than the listing rate
{% endhint %}

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (15).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

&#x20;

&#x20;

**Listing Rate**

Listing Rate is the rate at which users get your token when they purchase at the DEX. This listing rate only applies when the Presale ends and the token and funds get added to the liquidity pool of the Dex (DxSale creates an exchange pair for you automatically - no coding or manually adding required!).

{% hint style="info" %}
Once the funds are added, the market supply/demand for your token determines the price at which users can buy/sell at the DEX. If your token is bought heavily after listing - the price of the token will go up. This means that you will get less tokens for the same amount of native token. If the token is heavily sold after listing, the price of the token will go down. This means that you will get more tokens for the same amount of native token.&#x20;
{% endhint %}



{% hint style="info" %}
Listing Rate should be equal or less than the presale rate
{% endhint %}

&#x20;

**Soft Cap**

Soft cap / Soft capacity means the minimum amount of tokens that you will need to raise in order to consider the crowdsale/presale a success. Raising less than soft cap means you have failed the presale raise and the funds will automatically be back to the presale contributors and the custom token will be back to the presale creator.

{% hint style="info" %}
Soft cap cannot be less than 51% of hard cap amount
{% endhint %}

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (60).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

&#x20;

**Hard Cap**

Hard cap / Hard capacity means the maximum amount of tokens that you can raise during the crowdsale/presale.

{% hint style="info" %}
Hard cap cannot be more than twice the soft cap amount
{% endhint %}

&#x20;

**Minimum and Maximum Contribution amount**

Minimum and maximum contribution amount is the range at which a buyer can fund your token during crowdsale/presale. If the contribution is too high, the UI will automatically block the buyer. If the contribution is too low, the UI will automatically block the buyer.

{% hint style="info" %}
This is a good tool to stop any bulk buyers who can easily dump tokens at exchange post presale&#x20;
{% endhint %}

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (61) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
Minimum contribution cannot be 0, Maximum contribution cannot be lower than minimum and higher than Hardcap
{% endhint %}



&#x20;

**Project Information steps**

The project information step page looks like this where you can easily upload your Logo, Banner , Website, social links (youtube, github, twitter, reddit etc.) as well as project description.

{% hint style="info" %}
It is highly recommended that you fill out all of these to give your presale contributors and community every possible information about your project
{% endhint %}

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (27).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

To fill out the logo and banner link, you must have a link that ends with .png, .jpg, or .gif. You can upload your image/gif on a website such as [![](https://s.imgur.com/images/favicon-16x16.png)Imgur: The magic of the Internet](http://imgur.com/) in case you do not have a link that does not end with the image or gif extensions.

Once you upload your image to Imgur, copy the Direct Link as shown below.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (19).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Paste the direct link of the image or image address on to the logo link or banner link section as shown below

**More Features section**

This section is not enabled during this stage of presale creation and only available after you have created the presale listing.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (32).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Change Listing Pair**

{% hint style="info" %}
This feature must be enabled before Finalizing a presale after it’s successful! If you would like to use this feature, ensure you use this before clicking Finalize on your presale!
{% endhint %}

Changing listing pair means instead of listing your token with native coin such as ETH or BNB as liquidity, you can now use USDT or any other custom address as a listing pair. This is only available on DxSale and is a special feature that you can utilize to your token if you have custom needs or requirement. This feature is accessible after the presale as already been listed.

&#x20;

**Vested Claim**

This feature must be enabled before Finalizing a presale after it’s successful! If you would like to use this feature, ensure you use this before clicking Finalize on your presale!

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Vested Claim means limiting your presale buyers / contributors from getting the tokens they have bought during presale all at once. You can customize the amount of tokens they can get and when. This can be used to prevent instant dumping that can happen when your token has made it to the DEX. This feature is accessible after the presale has already been listed.

&#x20;

&#x20;

**Enabling Whitelist**

{% hint style="info" %}
It is highly recommended to enable this and use this feature before presale starts!
{% endhint %}

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (39).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Enabling white list gives you the ability to sell your tokens at presale to a set list of addresses instead of letting all of public to purchase. This is great for KYC control, private sale, or even as a marketing tactic. This feature ensures that certain buyers get priority. This feature can be disabled and re-enabled any time during a live presale.

&#x20;

&#x20;

**Scheduling Presale Section**

The scheduling is an important step in the presale creation process. You must choose the timings carefully to ensure that your presale creation is going smoothly and also to give you ample timing to enable features that you want to enable or to create hype for your crowd funding.

**Presale Start Time**

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (14) (3).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Presale End Time**

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (7) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Liquidity Unlock Time**

Liquidity Unlock Time must be minimum of 1 month from presale end time. This ensures that the liquidity pool token which acts like a “key” to the liquidity pool is safely locked. This makes it harder for bad players to pull liquidity from Dex and also ensures extra safety measures to your community

&#x20;

**Review and Submit**

Review your presale and submit by clicking Start Presale and clicking confirm metamask to confirm transaction
