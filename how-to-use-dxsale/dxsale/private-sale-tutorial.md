# Private Sale Tutorial

{% hint style="info" %}
Some of the features such as Vesting and White listing can be enabled and used after presale has been listed. If you want to limit the tokens being given out, please do it before the private sale starts. However, you must list the presale first in future time so you can edit these settings safely. It is recommended that you do this at least 24 hours before which gives both your team and DxSale team enough time to go through any plans to make this a smooth private sale.

This is the flow for DxSale's Private Sale

{% hint style="warning" %}
The following are the 6 commandments of DxSale that you must adhere to, to avoid issues and to have a smooth launch

* I understand the functions of my contract.
* I disabled all special transfer functions in my contract.
* I disabled all fees or anything similar while I do my presale.
* I have set Max Transaction Per Wallet to 100% of my supply.
* I did NOT renounce ownership of my contract.
* I am aware of what Liquidity is.
{% endhint %}

Once you understand how the presale flow works please see the tutorial steps below:

**Creating the Private Sale steps**

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/private sale 1.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Once you click on "Select" button, you will be greeted with the following steps and form. You must complete each steps and forms correctly in order to successfully list the presale. Estimated time is 10 minutes if you are doing everything correctly.

**Token Info**

### Private Sale Information  <mark style="color:orange;">**Do not worry if all of these are new to you, we will go through each of these so you better understand how to set up your very own private sale at DxSale! ☺️**</mark>

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/private sale 3.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Start With A Template**

This is an automatic overflow Information fill up system by our dapp. You can set your information here as per your hard cap. You need to click on Low cap Gem/Mid raise/Long term raise.

**Or Create Your Own**

**Soft Cap**

Soft cap / Soft capacity means the minimum amount of tokens that you will need to raise in order to consider the crowdsale/presale a success. Raising less than soft cap means you have failed the presale raise and the funds will automatically be back to the presale contributors and the custom token will be back to the presale creator.

{% hint style="info" %}
Soft cap cannot be less than 51% of hard cap amount
{% endhint %}

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (60).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

&#x20;

**Hard Cap**

Hard cap / Hard capacity means the maximum amount of tokens that you can raise during the crowdsale/presale.

{% hint style="info" %}
Hard cap cannot be more than twice the soft cap amount
{% endhint %}

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (8) (1) (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

&#x20;

**Minimum and Maximum Contribution amount**

Minimum and maximum contribution amount is the range at which a buyer can fund your token during crowdsale/presale. If the contribution is too high, the UI will automatically block the buyer. If the contribution is too low, the UI will automatically block the buyer.

{% hint style="info" %}
This is a good tool to stop any bulk buyers who can easily dump tokens at exchange post presale&#x20;
{% endhint %}

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (61) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
Minimum contribution cannot be 0, Maximum contribution cannot be lower than minimum and higher than Hardcap
{% endhint %}





**Private Sale Rate**

Private Sale Rate is the rate at which users get your token when they pay with native token during presale/crowdfunding/Initial Coin Offering/ Initial Dex offering



{% hint style="info" %}
Presale Rate must be equal or more than the listing rate
{% endhint %}

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (15) (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

&#x20;**Vesting**

In private sale at DxSale, you can decide how much money to receive right away and how much of the money to vest. Vesting means you are spreading the money raised coming to you in a scheduled manner. \
\
For example, in the screenshot below, it shows 50% of the funds that was raised will be coming 10 times in total spreading every 10 days. If you've raised 100 eth in total, with this settings you will be getting 50 eth right away and the rest of the 50 eth will be vested. The vested 50 eth will be split like the following:



<table data-full-width="true"><thead><tr><th>Day</th><th>Total Eth Received (%)</th><th>Eth</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>0 (successful finalized sale)</td><td>50</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>55</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>60</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>30</td><td>65</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>40</td><td>70</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>50</td><td>75</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>60</td><td>80</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>70</td><td>85</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>80</td><td>90</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>90</td><td>95</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>100</td><td>100</td><td>5</td></tr></tbody></table>



{% hint style="info" %}
The more you vest, the more confidence your investors get in your sale. If you vest 100%, then the investors know that you are going to receive the liquidity slowly.
{% endhint %}

**Token Distribution**

In Token Distribution section you will see a diagram in percentage format! It will show how much tokens for Presale, how much tokens for Liquidity, how much tokens for Platform and how much tokens will be unlocked and burned!

#### Private Sale Timing

Once you are ready, set your private sale start and end time. The start time should be a minimum of 10 minutes from your current time. The private sale end time can be as low as 10 minutes. However it is recommended that you start it 24 hours from now and end it after 1 hour in case of any issues.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Private sale 9.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Project Information steps**

The project information step page looks like this where you can easily upload your Logo, Banner , Website, social links (youtube, github, X(twitter), discord, reddit etc.) as well as project description.

{% hint style="info" %}
It is highly recommended that you fill out all of these to give your presale contributors and community every possible information about your project
{% endhint %}

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/private sale 5.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

To fill out the logo and banner, you need to click on Browse and upload an image with .png, .jpg, or .gif from your Device.

Once you upload your image you need to add social links of your projects such as: Website, X(Twitter), Telegram. After submitting logos and socials its time to add a good description for your project. For reference you can see your Presale Card Preview options at the right side of your project information section.

**More Features section**

This section is not enabled during this stage of presale creation and only available after you have created the presale listing.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/private sale 6.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="success" %}
By default the tokens are locked after a successful private sale, you can unlock the tokens for the buyers and enable vested claim if you wish to give the tokens out slowly. Dxsale lets you unlock the tokens manually to prevent any one from making a dex pair pool right away. These settings can all be accessed after the listing has been created. These are features that set DxSale apart from any other competitors who gives out your tokens and can cause issues.
{% endhint %}

**Affiliate Earning**

Empower your project with our affiliate program! Activate it after setting up creating your presale pool. Participants reap the benefits after the presale wraps up. Don't miss out on maximizing your project's potential.

Affiliate pays out referrers in native token.

But the project has to deposit extra tokens for another reason.

Let's say the hardcap is 10 BNB and your affiliate earning is 10%, 100 tokens are for presale.

I buy 10 BNB, you get 1 BNB affiliate.

The sale now has 9 BNB raised but I get tokens for 10 BNB (all 100), meaning whoever buys the remaining 1 BNB now needs the extra tokens to be able to also claim.

**Enabling Whitelist**

It is highly recommended to enable this and use this feature before presale starts!

<figure><img src="https://docs.dxsale.network/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F3286775751-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252F-MTT8AZhxr8LCTIIdY3-%252Fuploads%252FEOXCj7B4m68j04PmcWcs%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D86bc901e-ed16-453e-9387-7a6928dbc5dd&#x26;width=768&#x26;dpr=4&#x26;quality=100&#x26;sign=be83594d0997f71a0be4e81867f6c1fb021afd496f985bdd6d036f445a57d368" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Enabling white list gives you the ability to sell your tokens at presale to a set list of addresses instead of letting all of public to purchase. This is great for KYC control, private sale, or even as a marketing tactic. This feature ensures that certain buyers get priority. This feature can be disabled and re-enabled any time during a live presale.

**Review and Submit**

Review your presale and submit by clicking Start Presale and clicking confirm in your wallet to confirm transaction. Sale Creation fee is 100$ in native token and after your sale ends successfully you have to pay either 4% of raised amount or 2% of raised amount + 2% of sold token.
